# basic-to-do-list

jQuery basic to do list app

The scope of this project was an introduction to jQuery.

//
This one was challenging because translating from JS to jQ was not easy but a lot of that came from looking at it as a whole rather than taking small chunks and going line by line.
This is a project I could build upon and make my own. There's a lot of potential here.
